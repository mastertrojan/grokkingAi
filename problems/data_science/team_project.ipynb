    "Pandas has become the defacto package for data analysis. In this workshop, we are going to use the basics of pandas to analyze the interests of today's group. We are going to use meetup.com's api and fetch the list of interests that are listed in each of our meetup.com profile. We will compute which interests are common, which are uncommon, and find out how we can use topics of common interest to form teams for project night. \n",
